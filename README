# The first file README
Fundamental differences between GIT & SVN
Git is distributed version control systems(DVCSs), SVN is centralized version control systems(CVCs)

1. CVCs http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0102-tn.png
SVN 
+ Concentrated Mode: everyone checkout from central server.
+ Checkout the files in the repository 
+ The disadvantage of CVCs is that, it has belongs to the working server. (It the server goes down, nobody can collaborate at all) 

2. DVCSs http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0103-tn.png
Git
+ Creates a full repository with one command (Example: Clone, Fetch)
+ Git stores content as metadata, SVN stores just files.
Q: What is metadata?
A: Metadata is data of data
Ex: data of data
Means of creation of the data
Purpose of the data
Time and date of creation
Creator or author of the data
+ With Git we can Push our work to remote server AFTER collaboration, with svn everything is on the server
+ Git can handle the details of removing the branch. With SVN, the old copy is hold until the next Update
